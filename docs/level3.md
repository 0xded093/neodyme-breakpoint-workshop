# Level 3 - Tip Pool

# Usage

Ever needed an easy and secure way to tip people? This contract will solve all your donation problems: The operator creates vault, everyone who wants can then create a pool for their personal donation account. For tax-reasons all funds are stored centrally, you can just withdraw the desired amount whenever you need them, and pay taxes at that point.
